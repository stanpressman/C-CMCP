## Task Description
Add a "Back to Top" button to a test HTML page. The button should appear in the bottom-right corner of the viewport and scroll smoothly to the top when clicked.

## Context
This is a test task to verify the C-CMCP workflow is functioning correctly. We're testing the complete pipeline: task creation → Cursor implementation → API Claude validation → Stan approval.

## Requirements

### MUST (Critical - Blocking)
- **M1:** Create a simple test HTML page (test-page.html) with enough content to scroll
  - Acceptance: HTML file exists with at least 3 screen heights of content
  - Test: Open file in browser → page requires scrolling

- **M2:** Add a "Back to Top" button in bottom-right corner
  - Acceptance: Button visible in fixed position at bottom-right (20px from edges)
  - Test: Scroll down → button stays in bottom-right corner

- **M3:** Button click scrolls page to top
  - Acceptance: Clicking button smoothly scrolls viewport to top of page
  - Test: Scroll down → click button → page scrolls to top

### SHOULD (Important - Advisory)
- **S1:** Smooth scroll animation
  - Acceptance: Scroll transition is smooth, not instant jump
  - Test: Visual inspection of scroll behavior

- **S2:** Button has hover effect
  - Acceptance: Button changes appearance on hover (color/opacity change)
  - Test: Hover over button → visual feedback appears

### COULD (Nice-to-have - Optional)
- **C1:** Button only appears after scrolling down 200px
  - Acceptance: Button hidden at top of page, appears when scrolled
  - Test: Load page → no button. Scroll down → button fades in

## Files to Modify/Create
- `test-page.html` — Create new HTML file with content and back-to-top button

## Expected Behavior
- Page loads with sufficient content to require scrolling
- "Back to Top" button fixed in bottom-right corner (or appears after scroll if C1 implemented)
- Clicking button smoothly scrolls page to top
- Button has basic styling and hover effect

## Validation Criteria

**Automatic checks:**
- [ ] test-page.html created
- [ ] HTML is valid (no syntax errors)
- [ ] No inline JavaScript security issues

**Functional checks:**
- [ ] Button exists in HTML
- [ ] Button has fixed positioning CSS
- [ ] Button has click handler that scrolls to top
- [ ] Page has enough content to scroll
- [ ] Smooth scroll behavior implemented

## Testing Instructions
- [ ] Test case 1: Open test-page.html in browser → verify content loads
- [ ] Test case 2: Scroll down page → verify button stays in bottom-right
- [ ] Test case 3: Click button → verify smooth scroll to top
- [ ] Test case 4: Hover button → verify visual feedback

## Notes
- This is a test task - keep implementation simple
- Use inline CSS and JavaScript (single file)
- Use `window.scrollTo()` with `behavior: 'smooth'` for scroll
- Button can be text or emoji (↑ or ⬆️)
- No external dependencies or libraries needed

## Repo Rules Reference
N/A - This is a standalone test file, no repo-specific rules apply
