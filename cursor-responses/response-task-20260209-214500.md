## Summary
Created a standalone test HTML page with enough content to scroll and a fixed
"Back to Top" button that appears after scrolling and smoothly returns the
viewport to the top on click.

## Requirements Status
### MUST
- M1: Create test HTML page with enough content to scroll — PASS — `test-page.html` includes multiple sections.
- M2: Back to Top button fixed bottom-right — PASS — fixed positioned button at 20px offsets.
- M3: Button click scrolls to top — PASS — click handler uses `window.scrollTo` with smooth behavior.
### SHOULD
- S1: Smooth scroll animation — PASS — `behavior: "smooth"` used.
- S2: Button hover effect — PASS — background color changes on hover.
### COULD
- C1: Button appears after scrolling down 200px — PASS — hidden until scrollY > 200.

## Files Modified
- `test-page.html` — Added full test page with content, styling, and back-to-top behavior.

## Deviations From Spec (if any)
- None.

## Known Limitations / Edge Cases
- None identified for this simple test page.

## Manual Tests
- Not run (local browser test not executed in this environment).

## Notable Implementation Choices
- Added a 200px scroll threshold for button visibility and a small fade/slide-in
  transition to make the appearance smooth.
